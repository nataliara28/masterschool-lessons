# Exercise: Baking Scenario

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Find out what you can bake based on your ingredients.

# INGREDIENTS
flour = True
chocolate_chips = False
eggs = True
bananas = False
banana_flavoring = True
cream_cheese = True
vanilla_extract = False
lemon_juice = True

can_bake_chocolate_chip_cookies = flour and chocolate_chips and eggs
can_bake_banana_bread = flour and eggs and (bananas or banana_flavoring)
can_bake_cheesecake = cream_cheese and eggs and (vanilla_extract or lemon_juice)


# # RESULTS
print("Can I bake chocolate chip cookies?", can_bake_chocolate_chip_cookies)  # Output:
print("Can I bake banana bread?", can_bake_banana_bread)  # Output:
print("Can I bake cheesecake?", can_bake_cheesecake)  # Output:


# Bonus: Decide to make pancakes if you don't have specific ingredients for other recipes
# For pancakes you just need flour and eggs

can_make_pancakes = flour and eggs and not(chocolate_chips, bananas, banana_flavoring, cream_cheese, vanilla_extract, lemon_juice)
